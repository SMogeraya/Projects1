        <h2><u><b>TYPES OF DOGS</b></u></h2>
        <p>The dog was the first species to be domesticated,by hunter gatherers over 15,000 years ago,before the development of agriculture.Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids
            They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.

        <h2><u><b>TYPES OF DOG BREEDS</b></u></h2>
        <p>Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds.</p>
        <p>Let us try classifing dog breeds accordimg to their behaviour</p>
        <h2><u><b>Kid-Friendly Breeds</b> </u></h2><br>
           <p> Large dogs can get a bad rep sometimes, but the truth is that many large dog breeds are excellent family dogs. They may require some extra effort to look after (particularly those with long, thick coats), but these breeds tend to be devoted, playful, and affectionate. Keep in mind that large breeds require a lot of space! It’s not a good idea to get one if you live in an unsuitably small home. If you have room for a large dog and you want to find one that would fit in great with your family, these breeds are some of the most popular: </p>

        <h2><u><b>Medium Kid-Friendly Breeds</b></u></h2><br>
        <p>Medium sized dog breeds require less room than larger breeds, but still require as much (or more) attention. There are a lot of medium breeds that are great for families, but a select few are fantastic with kids of any age. If you’re looking for a medium-sized dog to complete your family, consider the following breeds:</p>

<p>Small dogs are one of the most popular types of dog in North America. There is a lot of variety in smaller breeds in appearance and temperament. What’s more, smaller breeds generally require less looking after than larger breeds (although this isn’t always true!). If you’d like to find a smaller dog that’s great with children, here’s a list of a few that meet those criteria:
